          Chester Bennington was an American singer, songwriter, actor and
          producer. He became famous as the lead vocalist of the rock band
          Linkin Park, one of the most popular and influential bands of the 21st
          century. He was also the vocalist of the bands Dead by Sunrise, Stone
          Temple Pilots, Grey Daze and Kings of Chaos.

          Bennington was born in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 20, 1976. He had a
          difficult childhood, suffering from sexual abuse, bullying and drug
          addiction. He found refuge in music, especially in rock and metal. He
          started singing in local bands, such as Sean Dowdell and His Friends?
          and Grey Daze, but did not achieve the recognition he wanted.

          In 1999, he auditioned for the band Xero, which later changed its name
          to Linkin Park. His powerful and emotional voice fit perfectly with
          the sound of the band, which blended rock, metal, rap and electronic
          music. The band's debut album, Hybrid Theory, was released in 2000 and
          became a worldwide success, selling over 30 million copies. The album
          was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America
          in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well
          as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales. He continued
          to serve as the band's lead vocalist for their next six studio albums,
          from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), with each charting
          within the top three spots of the Billboard 200.

          Bennington also explored other musical projects, such as Dead by
          Sunrise, a alternative rock band that he formed with the members of
          Orgy and Julien-K. He also joined Stone Temple Pilots in 2013,
          replacing the late Scott Weiland as vocalist. He also collaborated
          with other artists, such as Jay-Z, Slash, Santana, Steve Aoki, Motley
          Crue and Chris Cornell.

          Besides music, Bennington also ventured into film and television. He
          made appearances in movies such as Crank, Crank: High Voltage, Saw 3D
          and Artifact. He also participated in TV shows such as Saturday Night
          Live, Punk'd, The X Factor and Carpool Karaoke.

          Bennington struggled with depression, anxiety and addiction to drugs
          and alcohol throughout his life, starting in his childhood. He was
          also affected by the death of his friend and idol, Chris Cornell, in
          May 2017. On July 20, 2017, on what would have been Cornell's 53rd
          birthday, Bennington committed suicide at his home in Palos Verdes
          Estates, California. He was 41 years old. He left behind his wife,
          Talinda, and six children.

          Bennington was honored by his bandmates, family, friends and fans
          around the world. He was considered one of the best rock vocalists of
          all time, and his music inspired millions of people. He was also
          praised for his generosity, kindness and social activism. He supported
          various causes, such as suicide prevention, cancer awareness, animal
          protection and humanitarian aid.
